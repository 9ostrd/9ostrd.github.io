In these installations, I didn’t install TinyOS in normally. Because the software version is very old. it’s hard to find the installer from the internet and the installer files that we got. it has been damaged (May be from Virus or Malware). To solve the problem, I clone all of the required software, configuration and drivers from the installed machine to another one.
