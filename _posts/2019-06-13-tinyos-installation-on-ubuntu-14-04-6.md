This article has re-created an instruction to run TinyOS on currently Linux OS. I was tested with Ubuntu Desktop 14.04.5 (It's possible to use on Ubuntu 16.XX if all of the packages was supported)(I was tested on lasted Ubuntu version, but still not working) 32 bit on VirtualBox version 5.2.22 r126460 (Qt5.6.3).

I skip an installation of Ubuntu on VirtualBox. You can find the installation on the internet and do it by youself. I'll give only an important informations that uesed in this article.
